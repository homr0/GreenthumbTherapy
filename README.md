## Description
   The purpose of this application is to provide users/consumers with a tool that gives easy access to home and business based plants. After a greatdeal of research, our team detemined that there is not a single source to find home/business based plants that meet specific requirements. For example, many people love plants and all their benefits, such as cleaner air and aesthetics improvesments to home and office, but they have animals and possible alergies that must be take into consideration. 
  In todays fast paced environment, when users/consumers do not have the time and knowledge to search for the proper plants, we  have developed a solution to gives them a means to acces plant information using, web based technology (front and Backend).So, today, with the announcement of this application, Greenthumb Therapy, users/consumers, will have access to this application acrossdifferent platforms, such as laptop and or mobile devices, with the same clarity and fucntionality.
